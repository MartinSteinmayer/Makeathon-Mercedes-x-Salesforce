# Makeathon-Mercedes-x-Salesforce

## Setup

### Installing Dependencies

You will need npm, python and nodejs installed.

### Running The App

To run the app you will need to open two terminals, one you will go to the "client" directory and run "npm install" and then "npm start" and the other one you will run "python -m venv flaskvenv" then "source flaskvenv/bin/activate" to initiate the Virtual Environment to run the backend with "python3 (or python) flask-server/server.py". The Virtual Environment should already have the necessary dependencies, but if not, just download the ones missing.
